## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Smart Medication Search
Quickly find medications by name or active ingredient. The search system uses a remote data source to ensure up-to-date information on availability and pricing.

Stop wasting time searching for alternatives. Dua automatically suggests equivalent medications with the same active ingredients, helping users find cost-effective options.

### ❤️ Smart Favorites
Save your most important medications for quick viewing. Offline support is planned for future updates.

### 🛡️ Secure Access Control
Integrated security features including a sleek splash screen and access verification to ensure a professional and safe user experience.

### 🌍 Professional Arabic Support
Tailored specifically for Arabic-speaking users with professional **Cairo** typography and Right-to-Left (RTL) layout optimization.

### 📸 Smart Sharing
Share medication cards as high-quality images directly from the app, making it easy to consult with doctors or pharmacists.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: Medical Slate

Dua is built on the **Medical Slate** design language, characterized by a premium and calming aesthetic:

- **Calming Palette**: Deep Indigo (`#1E40AF`) and Medical Teal (`#0D9488`) on a soft Slate background.
- **Premium Components**: Custom-built cards, shimmers, and interactive elements.
- **Micro-Animations**: Uses `animate_do` for subtle, professional transitions that enhance user trust and engagement.
- **Typography**: Optimized readability with **Cairo** (Arabic) and **Inter** (Latin).
